## Custom Domain (Optional)

Want to use your own domain like `myworkouts.com`?

## Sharing with Friends

Your workout tracker is now public! Share the link with:

## Privacy Note

While the app is publicly accessible, your personal workout data stays on YOUR device only. Each person using the link will have their own separate data stored locally.

## Troubleshooting
